# Project4: Collaborative Filtering

### Code lib Folder

The lib directory contains various files with function definitions (but only function definitions - no code that actually runs).

For running SimilarityMeasures.java, you can use Eclipse to open this file. However, you have to provide 3 commad-line arguments: first one is the data file you want to parse, second one: number of rows of dataset, thrid one: number of columns of dataset

For MS: matrix_train.csv(replace your own path) 4152 172

For movie: movie_train.csv(replace your own path) 5056 1620

After running these codes, it will generate spearman correlation and vector similarity for each dataset
