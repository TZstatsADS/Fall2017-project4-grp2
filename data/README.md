# Project 4: Collaborative Filtering

### Data folder

The data directory contains data used in the analysis. This is treated as read only; in paricular the R/python files are never allowed to write to the files in here. Depending on the project, these might be csv files, a database, and the directory itself may have subdirectories.

Data Set 1: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Anonymous+Microsoft+Web+Data
Data Set 2: http://www.gatsby.ucl.ac.uk/~chuwei/data/EachMovie/eachmovie.html

Due to the size of some generated files, they can be found at these Dropbox folders:
